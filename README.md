*Current Version Defunct, See "UPDATE" Section Below*

*Summary*
So this is my capstone project for Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Program. This was a rigorous but rewarding project, and I am fairly satisfied with the result.

To test this project yourself, simply clone this repository to your local machine, and run the command "npm run prod". This will run the application. Then spool up the server with "npm start". I have the project running on port 8500, so open a web browser and type in "localhost:8500" to access the application.

I worked closely with my fiancee (an aspiring UX designer) on the app design (I was aiming for simplicity with the user experience). There are 3 buttons to interact with after entering the form; the "book flight" button (which takes you to Expedia), the "add more" button (which re-opens the form interface), and the "delete button" which deletes whichever trip is on display in the viewport.

*UPDATE*
The current version is defunct, due to the lack of free API's that utilize historical weather data...

When I turned this project into the Udacity team, it was able to report on weather trends from the years prior, estimate the planned trip's weather, and push a photo from Pixabay matching the weather and location...

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a fully functioning app at this time due to a lack of financial resources to afford more than a demo subscription for these API services. Until this changes, I will not be able to update this app further.
